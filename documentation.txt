Welcome the the ArcadeMenu Documentation!
This will go into a lot of detail about all of the programs and files of this project.

MODULES:
    This part of the modules documentation is about "gamesreader.pyw". Located in ArcadeMenu/modules/gamesreader.pyw.
    
        gamesreader is a module to read the gamelist located in ArcadeMenu/gamelist/games.txt
        
        On the first line, the os module is imported to get the full parent directory on line 4.

        On the third line, there is a function named "getNumberOfGames".
        This is used by ArcadeMenu to loop a certain number of times. (because ArcadeMenu reads the
        file from top to bottom, and will stop reading it at an empty line).
